#  (EN) Responsive e-commerce in JavaScript

This is a basic **responsive** project to code an e-commerce in **HTML/CSS and JavaScript**.

During the week of October 3rd, I attended the first classes at 3W Academy on Advanced JavaScript. I now intend to practice applying more JS to my web projects.
